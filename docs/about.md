# About

## Author

3rd-year Computer Science student at **HES-SO Valais-Wallis**, Sierre.

This portfolio documents my weekly progress on the **304 GenAI & Robotics** semester project — a full-time project spanning the spring semester 2026.

## The project

**Duckify** builds an automated pipeline that takes a text description, generates a 3D model of a rubber duck, applies AI-generated textures, 3D-prints the duck, and finally paints it using a 6-DOF robotic arm.

My contribution focuses on the **robotic arm painting** sub-system: kinematics, toolpath generation, TCP calibration, and trajectory execution.
